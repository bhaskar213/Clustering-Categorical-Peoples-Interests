# Clustering-Categorical-Peoples-Interests
This project involves 6000 people divided into 4 groups with 217 hobby and interest questions. Pre-processing was done beforehand to test the idea of the computer revealing new information. The goal is to cluster the groups based on their interests and potentially predict group membership through supervised learning.
